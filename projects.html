            <p>An endless runner-esque video game that relies on quick reflexes to collect as many coins before colliding into a game over! Developed in Unity as part of Berkeley's Video Game Design Decal.

            <h3>Mega Man X Randomizer</h3>
            <img src="img/old_x_rand.png" alt="picture of my randomizer" id='mmx'>
            <p>GUI that sends a randomized boss order of game for user to try out different combinations (For context the original games allowed players to choose whichever levels they wanted; naturally there would be an optimal sequence of stages to choose which will give the easiest time possible)</p>
            <p>The intent of this randomizer is to give players a sub-optimal route to take which effectively changes the way the games would be played (more sub-optimal routes leads to interesting challenges) Also extra constraints for the player too</p>
            <p>Also allows to email the user the text of the randomized boss order (This is a small project I made when I was new to coding)</p>
            <p>Developed in Python using the Tkinter GUI module</p>

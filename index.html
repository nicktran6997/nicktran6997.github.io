    <h1>NICHOLAS "THE MAN" TRAN</h1>
    <p>A bunch of text about me. I really like Mega Man and I am secretly Frank Ocean.</p>
    <p>Yeah seriously though, I am currently a freshman at UC Berkeley
      in the College of Letters and Science.  I am officially undeclared, but
      I am an intended CS major.  My heritage is pretty standard: parents are
      immigrants from Vietnam, and I was born here in Berkeley, CA. Despite being
      born in Berkeley, I spent most of my life in a closeby suburb named Hercules.</p>
    <p> Other than my academics, I also have a passion for video games. I can
      remember the days of playing Sonic Advance at the age of 5 to playing final
      fantasy 1-6 during my middle school years. In highschool, I moved on to League
      of Legends and managed to attain Diamond 4 this season. For the most part
      I hope I may continue this passion later on even beyond my college years. (
      Maybe move onto game development as a programmer or even software engineer?)</p>

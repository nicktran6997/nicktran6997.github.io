    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a junior software engineer who has been fiddling in several fields of programming from web design to data science to creating video games!</p>
    <p>In an ideal world, I would want my work to make a difference in the world and help those in need, but my journey so far has made me more pragmatic in realizing that I can't solve everything on my own. We all have to cooperate, so good luck to all of us!</p>
    <p>PS: Also an avid VG admirer from all aspects (music, graphics, story, design etc), but that alone will take several pages of pure text so I won't bore with the details</p>
